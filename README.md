<h2 align="left">Background</h2>

###

<p align="left">Had a couple school projects where we had to sort numbers. Finding an appropriate online number generator was always a hazzle, having to choose amount of columns, not knowing if newlines'd be included or not. Therefore I decided to create my own simple number generator where every number will be separated by a space (no newlines).</p>
